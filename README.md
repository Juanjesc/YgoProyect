## Why this proyect?
This project has been made in order to practice React.js and its different Hooks.

I'm a big fan of the Yu-gi-oh card game, and I wanted to have my own card finder, so I decided to make one.
In the future I will update this project with more features.

It is a webapp designed to be used on a mobile device, but it also has its own desktop view, fully responsive.

## What did I need for this project?

- Vite to start the project, more information here: https://vitejs.dev/guide/
- Some React libraries such as SweetAlert (https://sweetalert2.github.io/) and React Icons (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- For css styles: **TailwindCSS**, more info here: https://tailwindcss.com/
- At the moment the following hooks: *useState*, *useContext*
- For the spinner I used an external tool: https://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/
- Photoshop
- **The Most importantly, an api provider, in this case I used the public yugioh API:** https://ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/
